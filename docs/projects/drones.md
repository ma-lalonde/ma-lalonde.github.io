I joined [VAMUdeS](https://www.facebook.com/VAMUdeS/) as an undergrad student as soon as I started my Bachelor's Degree of Electrical Engineering. It was a lot of fun and definitely the best part of my studies. The projects I led include:
- Create a georeferenced aerial surveillance system with a verified 3 metres raw accuracy (from a vibrating drone flying 60 metres above ground at 20 m/s)
- Design a control GUI to monitor and control said surveillance system, including filtering data based on geofences
- Upgrade the three antenna systems and manage RF interference between the manual pilot, autopilot, and camera antennas
- Design a hexacopter drone from the ground up (although the frame was adjusted with simulations from another mechanical engineering student)
- Implement network QoS for an aerial surveillance system with sometimes _very poor_ bandwidth
- Create obstacle avoidance algorithms
- Design a few power circuits to keep the drones flying
- Pass on the knowledge to the next generation of _Vamudiens_

Our crowning achievements include winning the [AUVSI-SUAS competition](https://suas-competition.org/) three years in a row. Check out our team's [2016](/auvsi_suas-2016-journals-universite_de_sherbrooke.pdf), [2017](/auvsi_suas-2017-journals-universite_de_sherbrooke.pdf) and [2018](/auvsi_suas-2018-journals-universite_de_sherbrooke.pdf) technical report papers to learn what this is all about.
