# Chocolat Infini

I currently run Chocolat Infini, a bean-to-bar chocolate company I started from scratch in 2024 after a trip to Costa Rica and Ecuador.

More than a chocolate factory, it is a lab where I can modify machines and optimize the process of making chocolate.

A few of my bars were awarded gold medals at the [2025 Craft Chocolat Challenge](https://www.craftchocolatchallenge.com/season-four).

Possibly one of the most unique features of my small-scale operation is that _every single machine_ is modified and remote-controlled through a clean Home Assistant dashboard. That means bringing industrial rigorousness to a traditionally artisanal craft that allowed me to quickly improve on the recipes.

Among the fun projects related to chocolate I worked on to grow the business, we can find:
- A small closed-loop electric Behmor drum roaster, which perfectly roasts the cocoa beans in any weather.

- Closed-loop temperature controllers for every machine, including the stone melangers that grind the cocoa nibs and sugar to chocolate liquor and the tempering machines, which allow the chocolate to crystallize into a dark brown, shiny and tasty bar. It's a bit rough on the edges, especially as a 2-layer PCB, but it certainly gets the job done.

- The packaging, which I print and cut at the shop with a die cutter
- A full software integration between the website, payment processor, and accounting/inventory software (ERPNext), which saves a TON of time during tax season or when it's time to order new ingredients
