# Connaxio

Connaxio was a company I ran from 2021 to 2024 as my first entrepreneurial project, where I worked as a consultant for a few clients and published a few electronic circuits... after many revisions, where I went from cramming as many pins as possible in a small space to actually making a usable circuit.

Worth noting is that unlike most sane PCB designers, I made the boards myself using a LitePlacer Pick and Place machine, running the OpenPnP software. During that time, I thoroughly explored the limits of thermal flow, motor control, computer vision and 3D printing, as well as the importance of good lighting and ventilation.

Connaxio's projects have their own GitHub page where you can learn all about them: connaxio.github.io.
