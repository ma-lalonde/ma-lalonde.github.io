I specialize in the integration, optimization and automation of software, electronics and mechatronic systems, which I have been doing since 2013.

I enjoy solving technical problems while learning as much as possible about whatever new technologies I'm working with. Sometimes head first, always hands on and results-driven.

Check out a few of my projects or reach out to me via the contact form.

Cheers,<br>
Marc
